ðŸ“Š Interactive Dashboard in Excel
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship â€“ Task 3 (Dashboard Design).
The objective was to design an interactive business dashboard that helps stakeholders analyze Sales and Financial performance.

Although the original task suggested Power BI/Tableau, I implemented the dashboard using Microsoft Excel, showcasing the ability to build interactive and insightful dashboards without paid tools.

The Excel dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Compare performance across regions/products

Quickly filter data for business insights

Make informed business decisions with a simple, user-friendly interface
